What's the point of picking a date if nothing happened on it?

## How it works

This is a "bad datepicker". To select a date, you enter a Wikipedia search
query, which produces a list of articles. If the articles have any dates, they
will be extracted and displayed below the article headline and summary. To
select a date, you just click a date. Easy as that!

## Running

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. `open http://localhost:8080`

**Note: you will need to disable CORS checks, for example, `google-chrome
--disable-web-security`.**
